# Notes on Writing Clear Technical Posts

Good posts are **scannable** and *specific*.

## A simple structure

1. What problem are we solving?
2. What is the minimal working solution?
3. What are the trade-offs?

> If readers cannot restate your problem in one sentence, the post is too hard to follow.

## Tiny poll (local)

question: Which section helps you the most?
- Problem statement
- Minimal solution
- Trade-offs
persist: true

## Tip

Use short paragraphs. Prefer concrete nouns. Avoid “it”.
